This is a very early version of a mind structuring/note taking app for windows. 
It creates a mindmap with editable points which you can name, and add description to.
There are many types of points which all have different properties. Some of them can contain long texts and images(images are not implemented yet).
User can redact the mindmap using his mouse and if the cursor stays on a point for 1 sec, a short description is shown of what the insides are. 
It was planned to use ChatGPT API to implement an assistant on the left side of the screen. This would let the user create summaries right away and ask questions on the spot(however, I have no money).

The project was abandoned. Later on Obsidian added a similar mind map, so even tho I liked some of the features I added/wanted to add, I just stick with Obsidian and have moved on to other projects.
